# SecureSend: The SFTP Adventure 🚀

Welcome to SecureSend, where we make file transfer so secure, even your cat's secret plans for world domination are safe! 🐱‍👤

## What's This All About? 🤔

SecureSend is a robust, feature-packed SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) client and server implementation. It's like a secret tunnel for your files, but with fewer moles and more encryption!

## Features That'll Knock Your Socks Off 🧦

- 🔒 Secure file transfer using SSH protocol (because we're not animals!)
- 🗜️ File compression (squish those files like it's a hug)
- 🔑 Extra file encryption (for the paranoid... I mean, security-conscious)
- 👥 Multi-threaded server (handles multiple connections like a boss)
- 🖥️ User-friendly GUI (so easy, even your grandma could use it... maybe)
- 📁 Remote file management (like having really long arms)

## Installation: It's Not Rocket Science! 🚀

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureSend.git
   cd SecureSend
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (because we're not savages):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the package (it's like feeding your computer a delicious meal):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Generate an SSH key (it's like making a secret handshake):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f server_key.pem
   ```

5. Create a user config file (config/users.yaml):
   ```yaml
   cooluser:
     password: supersecretpassword
   ```

6. Update server config (config/server_config.yaml):
   ```yaml
   server:
     host: 0.0.0.0
     port: 2222
     key_file: server_key.pem
   root_directory: /path/to/sftp/root
   max_connections: 10
   ```

7. Create the root directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir /path/to/sftp/root
   ```

## Usage: Let's Get This Party Started! 🎉

1. Fire up the server (it's alive!):
   ```bash
   sftp_server
   ```

2. Launch the client GUI (where the magic happens):
   ```bash
   sftp_client
   ```

3. Connect, upload, download, and manage files like you're in The Matrix!
